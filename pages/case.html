                <p>J.I. Case founds Racine Threshing Machine Works in Racine, Wisconsin. The company produces a thresher based on an innovative design for separating straw and grain.</p>

                <p>Case begins manufacturing steam engines and builds the first steam tractor. The tractor is mounted on wheels but is still drawn by horses and only used to power other machines. By 1886 Case becomes the largest manufacturer of steam engines in the world.</p>

                <p>Case builds a gasoline-powered tractor. However, the market is not ready for the transition from steam, so Case waits until 1911 to reintroduce it.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p>By the turn of the century, steam is still the preferred source of power. Case produces a 110HP tractor that weighed up to 42,500lbs when loaded with coal and water. The tractor produced over 3000 ft-lbs of torque at 240 rpm and could pull up to a 12 bottom plow.
                Though very popular opposed to conventional horsepower, few farmers could afford the $3,600 price tag.</p>

                <p>The advent of the oil engine began to signal a change on the horizon, Case begins to focus on gasoline and oil engines. They hire race car driver Joe Jagersberger, who tests an engine by racing it in the Indianapolis 500. They begin manufacturing a series of kerosene tractors similar to the
                    Rumely Oil Pull. Steam still remains part of the Case business model.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p>Interest began to move from steam to the internal combustion engine in favour of a lighter and more agile tractor. Though the tractors were less powerful and could pull only 2 or 3 bottom plows, they could move much faster and were much more affordable. Case begins production
                    of the 'Crossmotor Series' which featured various models from 20 - 60 horsepower.</p>

                <p>Case ceases production of its legendary steam engines entirely. In the same year, it begins production of the 'Letter Series' tractors. The C and L models were released in 1929 followed by the D, S, V and LA in the early 40's, which featured variations for row crop and orchard.</p>
