                <p>Minneapolis-Moline was formed by a merger between Minneapolis Steel & Machinery, Twin City Tractors, Minneapolis Threshing Machine and Moline Plow. The merger saw factories in both Minneapolis, MN and Moline, IL; hence the name.</p>

                <p>The 'U Series' tractors begin production. Minneapolis-Moline pioneered the closed-cab tractor concept with the UDLX Comfortractor, also known as the Model U Deluxe. The model had bodywork as well as a fully-integrated all-weather cabin with a passenger seat.
                    With a price tag of $2,155, almost double that of John Deere and Farmall, and the advent of a recession, only 125 UDLX models were sold.</p>
