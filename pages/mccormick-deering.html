                <p>In 1831, Cyrus McCormick finalizes a version of a horse-drawn reaper. Cyrus and his brother, Leander McCormick, move to Chicago and in 1847 start the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company. McCormick developed a large network of salesmen capable of demonstrating various equipment in the field which led the companies ability to achieve high sales.</p>

                <p>The roaring 20's introduced what would become one of the most popular farm tractors, the Farmall. The Farmall was popular due to its light, versatile design and ability to conquer many farm jobs. Built with intentions to compete with Ford, IH would sell
                    100,000 Farmall units by 1930.</p>

                <p>International Harvester introduces the second generation Farmall, adopting the iconic Harvester Red #50; still used today. The 'Letter Series' tractors included the smaller A and B, mid-sized H and larger M.</p>

                <p>The 'Letter Series' tractors were updated to the 'Super Series'. Farmall also introduced its smallest tractor, the Cub. With a 60ci 4-cylinder engine, this tractor was aimed at the small and poor 'one horse farms' of the Deep South that still relied on
                    horse drawn equipment. With a price tag of $545, it also became popular among farmers as a second tractor. Such popularity kept it in production, largely unchanged, until 1979.

                <p>Production of the 'Hundred Series' began. The models featured a slightly different appearance but essentially remained the same as the 'Letter Series' tractors. Later productions began to feature an independent live PTO, however, International Harvesters
                    reluctance to update their tractor line and respond to changing times was becoming apparent.

                <p>International Harvester jumped into the larger tractor market with the '60 Series' tractors, featuring their first 6-cylinder engine available in gasoline or diesel. The excitement was short lived as growing reports of mechanical breakdowns in the field led to a recall later that year. Failure to re-engineer
                    critical drive components to accommodate the increased power from the larger engine was apparent. As a result, International Harvester lost many of its customers to competing brands.
